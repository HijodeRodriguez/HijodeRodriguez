### Hi there, my name is Hijo de RodrÃ­guez ðŸ‘‹

My creativity, experience and vision are key factors for the success of the projects in which Iâ€™m involved. I like to challenge paradigms of communication, innovating in concepts, formats and platforms. My goal is to significantly influence consumer trends of contemporary society.

As a digital creative, my close relationship with the development team motivated me to learn more about the existing  programming languages and their applications. This with the aim of having a clearer communication with the developers and to understand needs of each project to be developed.

I started learning the basic languages for web development: HTML, CSS and JS; this allowed me to give precise instructions on the requirements of a website or even develop such a project myself.

Recently, projects related to the blockchain, the crypto economy and non-fungible tokens have led me to learn Solidity for the creation of smart contracts.

This with the first objective of exploring new tools for artists to capitalize on their work; and, consequently, to explore its application to other industries where certification plays a critical role.
