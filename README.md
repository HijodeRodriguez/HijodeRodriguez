### Hi there, my name is Hijo de Rodríguez 👋

My creativity, experience and vision are key factors for the success of the projects in which I’m involved. I like to challenge paradigms of communication, innovating in concepts, formats and platforms. My goal is to significantly influence consumer trends of contemporary society.

As a digital creative, my close relationship with the development team motivated me to learn more about the existing  programming languages and their applications. This with the aim of having a clearer communication with the developers and to understand needs of each project to be developed.

Empecé aprendiendo los lenguajes básicos para el desarrollo web: HTML, CSS y JS; esto me permitió dar instrucciones precisas sobre los requisitos de un sitio web o incluso desarrollar un proyecto de este tipo por mí mismo.

Recently, projects related to the blockchain, the crypto economy and non-fungible tokens have led me to learn Solidity for the creation of smart contracts.

This with the first objective of exploring new tools for artists to capitalize on their work; and, consequently, to explore its application to other industries where certification plays a critical role.
